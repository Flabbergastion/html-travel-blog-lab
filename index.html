            <p>Last fall I had the pleasure of visiting Fire Island! I had a lot of adventures and memorable moments, I don't have time to share all of them but a few stories stood out! Day one was very hectic dealing with the airport and anxiety of travel but once I had checked in to my room and began to look ahead to my trip all those feelings fell away. With a quick prep session to make sure I had all my gear I hopped in a seaplane to head to Fire Island! The pilot was an older gentleman who regaled me with stories from the past and present of this mystical destination.</p>
